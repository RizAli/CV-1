## Rizwan ALi

- An enthusiastic junior developer, who is always looking for opportunities to learn and collaboratively        develop IT projects. Recently the passion of my coding took me to a bootcamp to learn about various recent        technologies currently used in the industry. Currently to improve my coding skills I am looking for a Junior      developer role in an organisation where I can work on various exciting projects with individuals who love         coding. 

## Skills

Pair programming: 
- At Makers Academy I was introduced the idea of pair programming since then I have been heavily involved in pair   programing on several projects.

Team work:
- It was a wonderful experience working in a team of four for my final project for a real client at Makers Academy. Initially we started with a hand written plan. There were times when we had to do individual search on the topics which were new to all of us but then after disucssing the topic as a team we were able to implement various new concepts. In the retro and during the project it was obvious for us that we were all effectively collaborating and communicating well.

Learning to learn:
- For my final team project at makers academy, our teams apporach of planning, scrums - as and when needed - and solving problems in fours when not been able to solve in pair for over three hours have been one of the reasons of our success and enjoyment. To solve problems we used various strategies such as stack overflow, articles and  tutorials etc.

## Transition from an ICT Teacher to a Junior developer:

I have always been interested in problem solving and learning new technology. I have been teaching ICT/computing in secondary school for almost 8 years. The recent focus and change in the ICT currriculum in secondary schools led me to learn about coding. After an extensive research I came across a bootcamp at Makers Academy. In the last 12 weeks I have been bombarded continuously with various technology concepts and terms. It has been really challenging and worthy experience as I have learnt alot about myself, how to approach solutions, when and what to ask to get better understanding of underlying concepts.
